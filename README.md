## Outline of content

### Nav

Three anchor tags. About, Projects, and Contact.

The contact link will have two social logos animate out from the side on hover.

If I have time I will try to impliment a dark mode/light mode switch.

### About section

Where I'm from, a brand statment of some kind.
Relevent skills

### Projects section

A z-grid layout of my projects with titles and descriptions explaing what the project is, why I did it, and what technologies were used.

Each preview will link directly to its github repo.

### Contact section

This will be a functional contact form that will send an email straight to my account.
If I can't get this to work I will create a card with my contact information.

Add clickable logo links to both my Github and my LinedIn.
